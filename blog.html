                    <blockquote>Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function become global variables. Global

                    Variables declared inside any function with var keyword are called local variables. Local variables
                    cannot be accessed or modified outside the function declaration.If local variable and global
                    variable have same name then changing value of one variable does not affect on the value of another
                    variable.

                    <p>
                        The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                        operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion
                        of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
                        The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
                        Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
